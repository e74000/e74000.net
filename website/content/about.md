Hi, I'm e74000!

I'm currently studying physics, CS and maths.

I put this website together to showcase my various projects and other things. You can see them on [GitHub](https://github.com/e74000/) too.

The things I'll generally post about here are: 

* Physics simulations
 
* Complex systems

* General programming shenanigans
 
* A bit of AI.
